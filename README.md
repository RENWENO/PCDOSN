The data processing files are: Dataproprect.py, DataShart.py, dataload.py, and hyperedge.py.
When running these codes, the file paths within need to be modified to one's local computer's file paths.
BAKEHANmodel.py is the new enhanced heterogeneous graph attention model we designed.
When running train.py, a BERT model needs to be downloaded, and the path of the BERT model in the code needs to be modified.
